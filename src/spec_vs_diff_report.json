  "summary": "The diff shows changes in App.tsx that introduce Vite-compatible environment checks (import.meta.env.DEV) and an error/loading fallback UI, but it does not provide clear evidence of the required pre-bundle process.env polyfill. The diff summary also indicates substantial unrelated feature/content additions (job API integrations, marketing/SEO copy, analytics, Stripe/Twilio features), which are outside the stated non-goals.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Add a safe `process.env` polyfill before the React bundle executes so fresh loads do not crash with `ReferenceError: process is not defined`, and ensure `process.env.II_URL` and `process.env.NODE_ENV` exist at runtime (without modifying immutable hook files).",
      "reason": "The diff includes changes to `frontend/index.html` but the shown excerpt contains only SEO/meta/performance tags; there is no visible inline script (or referenced polyfill) that defines a `process` global and `process.env` before the React bundle runs.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/index.html (truncated excerpt shows no process/env polyfill)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Fix the production black screen so the app reliably renders initial UI; console no longer shows a fatal startup exception preventing React from mounting; unexpected runtime errors show an error fallback UI.",
      "reason": "While `frontend/src/App.tsx` adds `ErrorFallback` and `LoadingFallback`, the diff excerpt is truncated and does not clearly show that a top-level error boundary is actually wired to render the fallback (nor does it show the specific startup exception being addressed).",

        "frontend/src/App.tsx (truncated; shows fallback components but not full boundary wiring / startup-fix evidence)"
